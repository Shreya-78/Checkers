# Python-Checkers-AI

# Overview
This project is a classic implementation of the Checkers board game, designed using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to enable an AI opponent. The game allows players to compete against the computer.

Features
Single-player mode: Play against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate easy gameplay.
Move Validation: Ensures that only legal moves are allowed, following the standard rules of Checkers.
King Creation: Automatically converts a piece to a "king" when it reaches the opposite side of the board, allowing it to move backward.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Algorithm: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
GUI Library: pygame

# How to Play
Start the Game:

Launch the game using the executable or Python script.

Making Moves:

Click on the piece you want to move. You will get possible moves.
Click on the destination square.

Winning the Game:

The game is won by capturing all of the opponent's pieces or blocking them from making a legal move.

Change the Board Appearance:

Modify the graphical assets (e.g., piece images, board background) in the assets/ directory.
